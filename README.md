# LFO-OSC
This is an oscillator which frequency is 1/100 of the frequency corresponding to each note number.

With the shape parameter, the scale can be changed from 1/100 to 1/1. Also you can mix the LFO sound and the note sound using the shif-shape parameter.

The "Form" parameter selects the waveform from options of sine wave, triangular wave, parabolic wave, sawtooth wave, ramp down wave, and square wave.
